Day 1 - GitHub and Markdown
================

In this repository/directory you should see two items:

- `README.md` - this document.
- `activity01-day01.pdf` - a PDF document that you will think critically
  about shortly.

## Task 1: View the PDF in GitHub

Read these directions first, then work through them.

1.  Locate and click on the `activity01-day01.pdf` file to view it. You
    might want to open this in a separate/new tab so that you can easily
    switch between this `README` file and the PDF document.
2.  On a piece of scrape paper or in a document on your computer,
    specify the different ways this document has been formatted using
    Markdown. Note that I tried to incorporate most of the Markdown
    skills that I use in my typical workflow. Can you identify them all?

![check-in](../README-img/noun-magnifying-glass.png) **Check in**

Take a moment to reflect on what this process is like compared to other
methods you have used for sharing documents with others.

- Did you identify 11 unique Markdown skills being used in the PDF? Try
  hovering your mouse over the text in the final bullet point in the PDF
  if you are only coming up with 10 skills.
- A more comprehensive guide to use Markdown syntax can be found on the
  [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) page
  along with best practices and cautions. What are two or three “Best
  Practices” that you weren’t aware of and will make an effort to pay
  attention to in your work for the next month?

## Task 2: Create a Document

On our Blackboard course site you were provided with items to read,
watch, and do prior to attempting this activity. Specifically, you were
asked to 1) explore methods for sharing information online, and 2)
explore websites/blogs/portfolios of people doing work that you are
interested in also doing or that give you inspiration. You will use this
information to start a reflection.

Verify that you are in the `day01-github-markdown` subfolder of your
GitHub repo. If you are currently reading this sentence, you should be
here.

1.  Near the top of this page, click on **Add file** and then select
    “Create new file”.
2.  Name your file `firstname.md`, where you have replaced `firstname`
    with your first name (or a pseudonym).
3.  Using multiple of your Markdown skills you gained from the
    interactive [Markdown
    tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/), add content to
    this new file. Minimally, you should respond to the four bulleted
    items below. Note that you can preview your work by clicking on the
    **Preview** tab at the top of your Markdown file. Remember there was
    a helpful cheatsheet here: <https://commonmark.org/help/>.
4.  When you have finished, scroll down and provide a **Commit
    Message**. Provide a brief description of what you did where it
    currently says “Create new file” in the **Commit new file** area at
    the bottom of the page. Then, click on the green button to commit
    your file.
5.  Verify that your `firstname.md` file looks how you intend, then post
    the weblink to this document in the **Activity 1 - Day 1** channel
    of our Teams workspace (linked on Blackboard). Look at what others
    post here to gain inspiration and feel free to cheer each other on.

Respond to these items:

- Using the Markdown syntax to embed an image from a link (not link to
  an image and not uploading a saved image file), select a meme that
  represents how Week 1 is going for you.
- Provide a brief explanation for why you selected the meme that you
  did.
- Add some thoughts about how you would like to share information about
  your learning (from your Week 1 Tasks - Do).
- For each website/blog/portfolio that you explored (from your Week 1
  Tasks - Do), provide a link to and brief discussion on what you liked
  about that resource.

## What is next?

So far our workflow has been:

![Blackboard icon to fork icon to edit icon to commit
icon](../README-img/current-workflow.svg)

Or in words:

1.  I posted a link to an activity repo on Blackboard,
2.  You made your own copy of this repo (fork),
3.  You did work on the activity, and
4.  You saved your changes (commit).

On **Day 2** of this activity, we will update this workflow to include
how we can work between GitHub and RStudio by creating a website. Then,
on **Day 3** of this activity, we will refresh your R skills.

Finally, here is our tentative schedule for the semester. I will include
this information with links to the text in your weekly tasks.
